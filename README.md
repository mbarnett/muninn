Greetings Github Source Searchers!
==================================

This is a one-off Rails project written 3 years ago in about 8 hours to demonstrate basic proficiency in Rails as it stood at that time. It was never hosted anywhere or really used at all outside of my laptop.

I really appreciate all of the emails about the insecurity of having config/initilizers/session_store.rb and its secret exposed to the world! You're doing a valuable service for a lot of people who have inadvertently opened themselves up to remote code execution, and that's great.

It's just that this particular project isn't anything that's ever going to run anywhere (indeed, the way it authenticated to twitter no longer even exists), so in this particular case it's out in public for pedagogical and archival purposes rather than for any practical reason.

Thanks again, though. In any other case you'd have saved my bacon.
